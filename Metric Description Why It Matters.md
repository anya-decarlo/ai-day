Metric	Description	Why It Matters
Epoch	Current epoch number	Helps track progress over time
Training Loss	Loss on training data (e.g., Dice loss)	Core measure of model learning
Validation Loss	Loss on validation data	Detects overfitting if it diverges from training loss
Dice Score	Measures overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentation	Standard metric for segmentation tasks
AUROC (Area Under ROC Curve)	Measures classification performance	Higher AUROC = better discrimination between classes
AUPRC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve)	Captures model performance in imbalanced datasets	Important for medical imaging tasks
PPV (Positive Predictive Value)	Precision (True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives))	Useful for evaluating false positive rate
NNE (Number Needed to Evaluate)	Inverse of PPV (1/PPV)	Measures clinical usefulness (lower = better)
Learning Rate	Current learning rate used in training	Tracks optimization adjustments
Batch Size	Number of samples per training batch	Helps analyze training stability
Data Distribution Shift	Summary stat (mean, variance of pixel intensities)	Detects dataset drift across epochs





âœ… Dataset Loaded â€“ Task04_Hippocampus images and labels are correctly formatted for MONAI.

The code uses DecathlonDataset to load the Task04_Hippocampus dataset
Appropriate transforms are applied for both training and validation data
Data is properly loaded with DataLoader with batch sizes and workers configured
âœ… Model Defined â€“ MONAI U-Net is set up.

A 3D U-Net model is defined using MONAI's implementation
The model has 5 resolution levels (16, 32, 64, 128, 256 channels)
It's configured for 3D spatial dimensions with 1 input channel and 3 output channels (background, anterior, posterior)
âœ… Loss Function â€“ Dice Loss selected.

The training uses DiceLoss with to_onehot_y=True and softmax=True
This is an appropriate loss function for segmentation tasks
âœ… Metrics Set Up â€“ Dice Score, AUROC, AUPRC, etc., will be logged.

The code tracks multiple metrics:
Dice Score using MONAI's DiceMetric
AUROC using scikit-learn's roc_auc_score
AUPRC calculated from precision-recall curves
PPV (Precision) from confusion matrix
NNE (Number Needed to Evaluate) calculated as 1/PPV
Other metrics like learning rate, batch size, and data distribution statistics
âœ… CSV Logging Ready â€“ Ensuring we're saving training progress for AI agent tuning.

A CSV file is created with appropriate headers for all metrics
Metrics are logged after each validation phase
Even for epochs without validation, basic metrics are still recorded
The CSV file is saved in the same directory as the dataset and model weights
