ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Visualize Key Metrics

âœ… Generate Plots for Trends Over Epochs
We need to see how the model is behaving before AI agents intervene.
	1.	Loss Curves
	â€¢	Plot: train_loss & val_loss over epochs
	â€¢	Goal: Detect overfitting (if validation loss increases while training loss decreases).
	2.	Performance Metrics Curves
	â€¢	Plot: dice_score, auroc, auprc over epochs
	â€¢	Goal: See if the model is improving consistently.
	3.	Hyperparameter vs. Performance
	â€¢	Plot: learning_rate vs. dice_score
	â€¢	Goal: Check if LR changes correlate with model performance.
